# Arrowhead Framework System of Systems NGAC Project (Java Spring-Boot)

## Description
A resource SoS with NGAC enforcement in Eclipse Arrowhead. In the demo, a consumer sends requests to access (read/write) data in a time series database, and is given permission only if the corresponding policy is set in the Policy Machine.

# Setup guide

## Simulated enviorment (VM-box) 
A VM-box system is provided for getting a quick startup or as an option, if not desided to setup the system yourself. This will be within a folder in a repo called VMBOX. This so if chosen to work within a simulated enviorment there is an existing system ready to be imported on your own VM-box.  

Make sure to make use of you device hardware or else errors might appear. 

## Launching the Arrowhead Core Systems

For the Arrowhead documentation, go to the [core-java-spring](https://github.com/eclipse-arrowhead/core-java-spring) repository.

A recording of the setup process on a Windows system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52Up5iDJKx4&ab_channel=AITIAInternationalZrt.

### Installation issues

I had some issues with installing the core systems and I decided to list them here in case it might be of use to anyone.

1) The docker setup doesn't seem to work out of the box due to a docker image issue. Me and several others have encountered the same issue but it is not yet officially fixed. See [this issue](https://github.com/eclipse-arrowhead/core-java-spring/issues/361)
2) I had to install MySQL 5.7+ instead of the newer MySQL 8.0+ versions when doing a native install since the SQL scripts in the core-java-spring repository uses deprecated commands
3) I had to allow remote connection in MySQL config to successfully run the Arrowhead SQL scripts

## Setting up the NGAC server

Download [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html) and clone the [NGAC Policy Machine](https://github.com/esen96/tog-ngac-crosscpp-LTU).

Follow the setup instructions in chapter 9 of the pdf documentation. For this project, we run the server in JSON mode, this is done by navigating to the root folder of the NGAC repository and running the ``./ngac-server -j`` command after the systems have been installed. 

Note that there might be security related authorization issues when running the server on a Windows system, which is why the NGAC server has been used mainly on Linux systems.

To set the demo policy for this project and run a few tests, navigate to the ``sos-ngac-demo`` folder and execute the ``demo.sh`` script.

## InfluxDB configuration
Enable HTTP communication in your influxDB config file and bind the port to its original address, leave the standard time formatting as is.

The DB configuration can be deduced by looking at the [Resource Access Point Constants](https://github.com/esen96/sos-ngac/blob/master/sos-ngac/sos-ngac-resource-system/src/main/java/ai/aitia/sos_ngac/resource_system/rap/RAPConstants.java).

In essence: 
* Create a root user with full privileges and the same configuration as listed in the RAPConstants file. Alternatively, you can create a superuser with your own information, in which case you'll need to change some of the constants. 

* Create a database either with the same name as the one listed in the constants, or create one with another name and change the constant.

* The measurement used in the demo will be automatically created and populated by running the sensor in the Consumer application. 

## Running the project

1) Clone this repository to run the project natively. Alternatively, you can download the application executables from the latest release of this repository.
2) Start the NGAC server in JSON response mode by running the command ``./ngac-server -j`` in the [TOG PM project](https://github.com/esen96/tog-ngac-crosscpp-LTU)  root folder.
3) Load and set the correct policy file by navigating to the ``sos-ngac-demo`` folder inside the [TOG PM project](https://github.com/esen96/tog-ngac-crosscpp-LTU)  root folder. Run the ``demo.sh`` file and confirm that the server returns the correct response for each test case.
4) If you're using the application executables in the provided release, then the following step is not necessary. However, if you plan on running this project natively, then navigate to the root folder of this reposity and install the necessary dependencies:

```
mvn install
```

## Authorization settings

It might be helpful to look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BHemnv3mQA&ab_channel=AITIAInternationalZrt.) for a demonstration of how a sample system is run. The steps for this project will be very similar to the ones in the video. Note that the authorization setup is only required when starting the system for the first time. 

1) Start the Arrowhead Core Systems on your machine. For this project, only the local core systems are necessary (Service Registry, Authorization, Orchestrator). Hence, you can run the start_coresystems_local.sh script for less bloat when using the Swagger API:s and reduced cpu usage.
2) Make sure you have access to the Swagger API:s of the Service Registry at ``https://localhost:8443``, and Authorization at ``https://localhost:8445``. If you have not done this before, you may have to import the sysop.p12 certificate from the core-java-spring repository to your browser. See the video or [the documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-arrowhead/core-java-spring) for instructions.
3) Run the Policy Server- and Resource System provider applications. These providers automatically register their services in the Service Registry core system. 
4) Go to the Swagger API of the Service Registry, open the ``Management`` tab and call ``GET serviceregistry/mgmt`` -> ``Try it out`` -> ``Execute``. 
5) Copy the entire JSON body of the ``query-interface`` service by the ``policyserver`` provider and the ``request-resource`` service of the ``resourcesystem`` provider. Save this information somewhere like a temporary .txt file as you will need it for setting the authorization rules.
6) Register the consumer by heading to the Swagger API of the Service Registry. Under the tab ``Management``, use ``POST serviceregistry/mgmt/systems`` -> ``Try it out`` and fill in the body of the consumer:

```
{
  "address": "localhost",
  "port": 8080,
  "systemName": "resourceconsumer"
}
```
Click ``Execute`` and you should get a JSON response with the full body of the consumer. Also save this data along with the data from earlier.

7) Go to the Authorization Swagger API at https://localhost:8445 and go to ``Management`` -> ``POST authorization/mgmt/intracloud`` and enter two sets of authorization rules.
 * Consumer -> Resource System: Fill the ``consumerID`` field with the ID from the resourceconsumer body JSON response saved from earlier. Enter the ``interfaceID``, ``providerID``, and ``serviceDefinitionID`` of the ``request-resource`` service system definition of the ``resourcesystem`` provider that we saved from earlier
 * Resource System -> Policy Server: Fill the ``consumerID`` field with the ID from the ``resourcesystem`` provider ID. Enter the ``interfaceID``, ``providerID``, and ``serviceDefinitionID`` of the ``query-interface`` service system definition of the ``policyserver`` provider that we saved from earlier
8) Restart the resource system application
9) You should now be able to run the consumer. Start by running the sensor, then instantiate a new consumer and send your queries!

## Manually setting up a service

To set up a new service you have to go through some steps.
First you can implement it in one of the controller files (PolicyServerController, ResourceSystemController) or you could create your own controller class. What you do here is you map a way to reach your wanted service, which is not yet existing.

Actually adding the service is done in MySQL. You add and set up the correct connections there. This has to be done in order. 

MySQL steps in order:
1) Service_definition. You have to add a new service in the service_definition table to be able to register a new service in the service_registry.
2) Service_registry. Here you register the service. The service_id can be extracted from the service_definition table and the system_id is what system the service is requested from.
3) Authorization_intra_cloud. Create access for the service. You have to add the correct consumer and provider IDs according to your service. Interface_id is 1 or 2 which represents SECURE or INSECURE mode respectively.
4) Authorization_intra_cloud_interface_connection. Set up connections for the service.
5) Service_registry_interface_connection. Set up connections for the service.

Here is an example, which actually is used to implement the latest policy update service, you can use this but you do have to change the IDs to match your IDs:

1)
```
INSERT INTO service_definition(service_definition) VALUES ("policy-update");
```
2)
```
INSERT INTO service_registry(service_id, system_id, service_uri, metadata) VALUES (23, 14, "/pu", "http-method=POST");
```
3)
```
INSERT INTO authorization_intra_cloud(consumer_system_id, provider_system_id, service_id) VALUES (13, 14, 23);
```
4)
```
INSERT INTO authorization_intra_cloud_interface_connection(authorization_intra_cloud_id, interface_id) VALUES (4, 2);
```
5)
```
INSERT INTO service_registry_interface_connection(service_registry_id, interface_id) VALUES (630, 2);
```


After the service is created and you have mapped a way to reach it, you have to send a request to use it.
To send a request to the added service you need to first create an orchestration request, get the orchestration result and then send this result with a DTO of some sort, could be a ResourceRequestDTO or a PolicyRequestDTO. To understand this better you can look inside the ConsumerMain file.
